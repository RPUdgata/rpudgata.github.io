                        As a recent graduate with a B.Sc. (Honours with Research) in Physics, my enduring passion for Physics and Mathematics continues to drive me. 
                        My focus centers on advancing our understanding of cosmology, particularly in gravity-related phenomena. 
                        I am enthusiastic about pursuing further education, with aspirations for a Master’s degree followed by a Ph.D. 
                        My specific interests include gravitational waves—ripples in spacetime caused by massive objects in motion and the enduring mysteries of black holes. 
                        These cosmic entities, born from collapsed stars, exert extreme gravitational forces that warp spacetime around them. 
                        Delving into these phenomena promises to unveil some of the universe’s most profound secrets.

                            This report delves into the elegant application of Wien's Displacement Law to ascertain the surface temperatures of A to K stars, while also exploring the inherent limitations associated with this method. 
                            The study encompassed meticulous measurement of the spectra of these celestial bodies, while duly considering atmospheric and instrumental factors, with the aim of identifying the wavelengths at which their intensity reached the zenith. 
                            By adeptly employing Wien's law, the subsequent determination of surface temperatures became possible. The findings revealed a commendable alignment for F to early K stars, whereas A and later K stars exhibited substandard accord, 
                            primarily due to deviations from the ideal black-body spectra and the constraints posed by the measurement equipment in capturing the peak intensities at profound red and blue wavelengths.

                            Polyaniline (PANI) is a conducting polymer that has gained attention as a matrix material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
                            catalysts due to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and stability. In this comparative study, the electrochemical
                            properties of nickel oxide (NiO) and cobalt (II,III) oxide (Co3O4) catalysts, both embedded in a PANI matrix, were investigated
                            and compared for ORR. The NiO and Co3O4 catalysts were synthesized using a simple reduction method and embedded in
                            the PANI matrix through mechanical mixing. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fouriertransform
                            infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the NiO/PANI
                            and Co3O4/PANI catalysts was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results
                            showed that NiO/PANI catalyst possessed slightly higher activity than the Co3O4/PANI catalyst. The stability of the catalysts
                            was also investigated from a cyclic voltammogram, where the catalysts were cycled between −0.7 V and 1.5 V for 100 cycles.
                            The results showed that the NiO/PANI and Co3O4/PANI catalysts both exhibited good stability. Overall, the comparative study
                            demonstrated that both NiO/PANI and Co3O4/PANI catalysts exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR. The
                            study also showed that the PANI matrix provided stable and conductive support for the catalysts. The results suggest that both
                            NiO and Co3O4, embedded in a PANI matrix, have the potential to be used as low-cost and efficient catalysts for ORR.
